Bugfix
   * For the time being, when ticket age is lower than maximum allowed age and
     greater than lifetime, client can still do a resumption connection. That is
     unexpected.

API changes
   * Add mbedtls_ssl_session_conf_ticket_lifetime() to configure lifetime in
     f_ticket_write() callback
   * ticket_lifetime parameter of f_ticket_write() is deprecated for tls13
     server.
